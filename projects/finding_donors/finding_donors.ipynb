    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees\n",
    "    * DTs can be used in industry to improve customer experience in a telephonic conversation with software support teams. Using previous data, we can identify what are the usual problems that customers face and how support executive diagnoses the root cause for them step by step. These diagnostic actions can be modelled as a tree to arrive at the root cause/solution of the problem.\n",
    "    * Decision trees are transparent and easy to understand retrospectively. Every outcome can be explained by a series of forks in the tree which makes for easier debugging and subsequent tweaking. It performs well with categorical as well as continuous datasets and even when features have non-linear relationships with each other. It also performs well without requiring a lot of data preprocessing.\n",
    "    * Tend to overfit so if not tuned correctly can result in a lot of variance. DTs would optimize heavily for the training set so if training set is small or quite different from testing set, they will often perform poorly in testing.\n",
    "    * A lot of features in the dataset like capital_gain, workclass, education, occuptation can be inferred to be intuitively related to income of a person. If max_depth and forking threshold hyperparamters are tuned to prevent overfitting, its possible to see relationships emerge across features that will be well represented by a DT. Splits around if person has done higher studies or not, or further splits around what role are they working in (whether its an executive position or a blue-collar job) will probably capture the income status of the person pretty well since they are seemingly linearly related\n",
    "* SVM\n",
    "    * SVM can be used for image classification. Features from images can be extracted using other algorithms, like color change across pixels, texture, etc and these can be fed to SVM. For example, an SVM classifier for detecting ginger in a photo can be trained by feeding it features from images which have ginger in it and ones which don't.\n",
    "    * SVM can model non-linear relationships among features to give predictions which have better accuracy. Using RBF/poly kernels, user need not transform data in higher dimensions (if x,y are features then this would mean, xy, x^3, y^2, etc). SVMs incorporate classification+margin error so they have lesser chances of overfitting as compared to DTs and can generalize better.\n",
    "    * SVMs can take a lot of time to train well since they are more computationally intensive. If there are a lot of features, training time for SVMs can shoot up a lot and may not be a good option.\n",
    "    * The dataset size is not very large, so SVM can be trained in a reasonable amount of time over this dataset. Also, while there are some features which seem to be linearly related with income of a person as mentioned in Decision Tree explanation above, there are a bunch of other features liek relationship, race, sex, age which may not be easy to generalize using DT's and SVM with a non-linear kernel may give better decision boundaries overall. Evaluating SVM along with DT will give me a good idea about the dataset and the relationship of features with each other in the problem domain.\n",
    "* Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)\n",
    "    * Adaboost has been used in real time frontal face detection where weaker classifers around certain facial features are cascaded to create a strong model. https://www.nada.kth.se/utbildning/grukth/exjobb/rapportlistor/2006/rapporter06/jorgensen_anders_06110.pdf\n",
    "    * Adaboost works with weak classifiers and using boosting techniques can produce a model with much better accuracy score. One can choose to do the above instead of choosing a complex classifier like SVM with multiple hyperparameters. This of course does not apply if you are using SVM with Adaboost. Adaboost on its own does not require to tune a lot of parameters and gives good results in practice.\n",
    "    * Accuracy can get affected if training dataset has outliers. Adaboost also does not perform well when there is a lot of noise in the dataset.\n",
    "    * Given the dataset, its possible to have simple learners(like decision 1-level tree) around these features and cascade them to produce a stronger model for predicting income. Adaboost training methods help in tackling high dimensionalities by focusing on the important ones which will help here for the algorithm to converge on relevant features out of the total 103 and reduce execution time during training as well as testing.\n",

    "DecisionTreeClassifier performed the best on f-0.5 score against training set but poor results with testing set which is a classic example of overfitting. On the other hand, Adaboost and SVC have given consistent f-0.5 and accuracy scores across both testing and training data sets indicating a more generalized fit of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost model has given highest f-0.5 score on testing sets when trained on 100% data(and even when trained with lesser amount of data). SVC has been a close runner-up in terms of F-beta score of testing set but on the other hand it has taken an enormous amount of time to learn and predict as compared to Adaboost. Also, when given a small dataset to train(1%), SVC has failed disastrously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering how Adaboost has fit well on the training dataset and performed admirably on the testing dataset with highest f-0.5 scores among all the candidates, it seems like a good choice for the given data. It has not overfit the dataset unlike DecisionTreeClassifier and has given better f-0.5 scores than SVC on the testing dataset. It has also achieved this in a fraction of time taken by SVC which was the next best alternative among the three. AdaBoostClassifier can be further tweaked by playing around with base estimator and boosting rounds to produce a better fit for the dataset."

    "Adaboost comes from the class of ensemble methods which take a series of weak learners and converge their results to create a strong model. Adaboost takes a base estimator as input which is not required to be complex. Usually, decision trees are selected as base estimator with limited max depth. The base estimator learns few characteristics of the dataset in the first iteration. Subsequently, higher weights are assigned to misclassified training data points which are to ensure that subsequent iterations focus more on them (boosting). In the next iteration, a new learner is created which gets informed by the assigned weights in the first iteration. This process of iteration is repeated N times to generate a series of learners, each getting informed by the learners which have come before them in the boosting process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost predicts by converging the characteristics learnt during all the iterations. Weights are assigned to each weak learner in relation to their accuracy score and this weight is assigned to their proposed answer for a prediction. The answer that has the overall highest weighted score is the output of AdaBoostClassifier.\n",

Also capital-loss turns out to be 2nd most important which was a surprise.\n",

    "* occupation and education are less important than the emphasis I had placed on them. Probably successful entrepreneurs and business men are from all kinds of education backgrounds. capital-loss seems an important feature which was a surprise. In retrospective, probably people earning less are forced to sell properties/investments in haste to meet ends and this is often at less than purchase price. This is a guess, I am not sure of the exact reason."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
